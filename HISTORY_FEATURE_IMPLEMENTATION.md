# ReasoningAgent History Feature Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the history feature for the ReasoningAgent as specified in the task. The agent now passes execution history to the LLM, providing critical context about previous steps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `_generate_llm_prompt` Method

**File**: `/Users/danylohorlov/GitHub/ONIKS_NeuralNet/oniks/agents/reasoning_agent.py`

- Added `state` parameter to access tool outputs and message history
- Added dynamic history section before the QUESTION section
- Updated method signature and documentation

### 2. Added New Helper Methods

#### `_build_history_section(state: State) -> str`
- Creates the "--- HISTORY OF PREVIOUS STEPS ---" section
- Processes tool_outputs to generate step-by-step execution history
- Returns empty string if no previous steps exist

#### `_extract_tool_args_from_history(tool_name: str, message_history: List[str]) -> dict`
- Extracts tool arguments from message history
- Correlates tool extraction messages with argument extraction messages
- Handles both JSON and Python dict formats

#### `_format_args_for_display(args: dict) -> str`
- Formats tool arguments for clean display in history
- Uses JSON formatting with proper spacing

#### `_summarize_tool_result(tool_output: any) -> str`
- Creates concise summaries of tool execution results
- Handles different output types (success, error, empty, etc.)
- Truncates long outputs while preserving key information

### 3. Updated Method Call

- Modified the call to `_generate_llm_prompt()` in the `execute()` method to pass the state parameter

## Implementation Details

### History Section Format

The history section follows this format:

```
--- HISTORY OF PREVIOUS STEPS ---
Step 1: Executed tool 'write_file' with arguments {"file_path": "hello.txt", "content": "Hello ONIKS!"}. Result: Successfully wrote 12 bytes to /content/ONIKS-NeuralNet/hello.txt
Step 2: Executed tool 'execute_bash_command' with arguments {"command": "cat hello.txt"}. Result: Output: Hello ONIKS!
```

### Key Features

1. **Dynamic Generation**: History section only appears when there are previous steps
2. **Argument Extraction**: Intelligently extracts tool arguments from message history
3. **Result Summarization**: Provides concise but informative result summaries
4. **Multiple Tool Support**: Tracks all tool executions in sequential order
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing or malformed data

## Benefits

### Before Implementation
- LLM had no context about previous executions
- Could recommend tools that were already executed
- Made decisions without knowing current state
- Example: Recommended reading a file that didn't exist yet

### After Implementation
- LLM sees complete execution history
- Understands what tools have been run and their results
- Makes informed decisions based on current state
- Example: Knows file was created successfully, can safely read it

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests that verify:

1. **No History**: First step correctly shows no history section
2. **Single Step History**: Second step shows previous execution
3. **Multiple Steps**: All previous executions are tracked
4. **Argument Extraction**: Tool arguments are correctly extracted and displayed
5. **Result Formatting**: Different output types are properly summarized
6. **End-to-End Flow**: Complete workflow with history providing context

### Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ History section generation
- ✅ Argument extraction from message history
- ✅ Result summarization for various output types
- ✅ Sequential step tracking
- ✅ Context provision to LLM

## Code Quality

- **Clean Code**: Follows PEP 8 standards
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings for all new methods
- **Type Hints**: Proper type annotations throughout
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases
- **Modular Design**: Helper methods with single responsibilities

## Specification Compliance

The implementation exactly matches the specification requirements:

1. ✅ Added "--- HISTORY OF PREVIOUS STEPS ---" section before "--- QUESTION ---"
2. ✅ Populated based on state.tool_outputs and state.message_history
3. ✅ Provides concise descriptions of tool executions and results
4. ✅ Shows exact format: "Step 1: Executed tool 'write_file' with arguments {...}. Result: ..."
5. ✅ Gives LLM critical context to understand previous steps
6. ✅ Enables better decision-making for subsequent actions

The feature is now ready for production and will significantly improve the LLM's ability to make contextual decisions in multi-step workflows.
